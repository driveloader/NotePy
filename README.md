<h3 align="center">‚Äî An Enhanced Version of Notepad (originally by pratyushjain122) Built with Python & Tkinter ‚Äî</h3>

### üî• NotePy transforms the original notepad-python project by pratyushjain122 into a not-so-modern (but still nostalgic) yet fully-featured text editor designed for everyday use. It's a more efficient replacement for Notepad, but with a modern twist. Because why settle for ordinary when you can have extraordinary?
                       # Latest Update: Version 1.3 - New Features and Window Adjustment
&nbsp;

## What is Tkinter?

#### üëâ Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit.
#### üëâ While there are other GUI toolkits for Python, Tkinter is the go-to choice due to its simplicity and seamless integration with Python.

&nbsp;

## What is NotePy?
NotePy is an upgraded text editor based on the original notepad-python project. It has a sleek user interface and enhanced features, all built using Python and Tkinter. It‚Äôs like Notepad, but without being created by a company that charges you for an operating system üíÄ. (You probably know what it is, MichealSoft)

&nbsp;

## Features

### Original Features (from [pratyushjain122's notepad-python project](https://github.com/pratyushjain122/notepad-python)):

1. **New File**: Create a new, blank document. Self-Explainatory
2. **Open File**: Open and load an existing file. Self-Explainatory
3. **Save File**: Save your document. Imagine losing your 2000 lines of code just because of a cat stepping on your power button. (My cat btw)
4. **Cut**: Cut selected text. Self-Explainatory (Haven't came up with a new joke **yet**)
5. **Copy**: Copy selected text. Because good ideas deserve to be duplicated, like that one meme you keep sending to everyone.
6. **Paste**: Paste text from the clipboard. Reuse like a pro‚Äîjust don‚Äôt overdo it like that one guy at the buffet. (That one guy at my nearby buffet restaurant)
7. **View Help**: Access help information for the application. 

### New Features in NotePy:

1. **Enhanced Edit Menu**: Now includes "Undo," "Redo," "Find,", "Replace" and "Select All" features. It‚Äôs like having an editor‚Äôs undo button for life. Just don‚Äôt try to use it on your last relationship. (lol)
2. **Convenient Hotkeys**: Adds various hotkeys to streamline your workflow:
   **For Example:**
   - **New Window**: Open a new instance of the application (Ctrl+Shift+N).
   - **Save As**: Save the current file under a new name (Ctrl+Shift+S).
   - **Select All**: Select all text in the editor (Ctrl+A).
4. **File Association**: Ability to open a `.txt` file directly via "Open with NotePy" from the file context menu.
5. **Status Bar**: Displays real-time document information, including:
   - Cursor position (line and column number). Never lose your place again‚Äîunless you accidentally move your cursor to another galaxy. üñ±Ô∏è
   - Word count. Because sometimes you just need to know how many words you‚Äôve written‚Äîand how many you still owe your novel. üíÄ
   - Line endings (e.g., CRLF). For the technical wizards out there. It‚Äôs like knowing whether to use a fork or a spoon.
   - File encoding (e.g., UTF-8). 
6. **Format Menu**: Adjust the global font style and size. 
7. **Enhanced File Menu**: With new indispensable features like "New Window" and "Save As" to enhance user's workflow.

## What's Included in This Project üëú

### Portable Version 

- **Description**: A download-and-play version pre-compiled into an executable (.exe) that runs on any Windows machine without installation. It‚Äôs the software equivalent of a Swiss Army knife‚Äîversatile and always ready. Perfect for when you need a quick fix without the fuss!
- **Use Case**: Ideal for those who prefer a plug-and-play application or want to keep it on a USB drive. No installation required‚Äîjust run and go! Like a fast-**text** drive-thru. (Get it? Fast-Food drive thru for text editing)

### Install Version 

- **Description**: Install NotePy on your machine for a smoother workflow. One-click, and it‚Äôs on your device‚Äîno more searching for the portable file. Installation makes it as easy as pie. Just don‚Äôt ask us to bake the pie!
- **Use Case**: Ideal for those who want NotePy integrated into their system for everyday use. Installation makes it easy to access NotePy without the hassle of finding and running the portable version.

### Source Code

- **Description**: The complete source code for NotePy, available for download and compilation. Obviously, what would you expect more from an open source project? (lol) It‚Äôs like a DIY kit for tech enthusiasts!
- **Use Case**: Perfect for those who prefer to compile the software themselves, have trust issues with those .exes, or need to run it on different operating systems. Great for the tryhards who compile Gentoo 10 times a day. (They exist, and they‚Äôre awesome!)

## GUI Overview üß©

A GUI (Graphical User Interface) allows users to interact with software through visual elements like buttons, text fields, and menus. 
## We tried our best to replicate the classic Notepad GUI, but remember, it's not a 100% accurate replica because God knows the Notepad source code. It's created by a company that creates proprietary software anyway. üíÄ

&nbsp;

## How It Works üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### ~ When you launch NotePy, a user-friendly GUI window will open, and you‚Äôll be ready to write and edit text just like in any standard notepad application. It‚Äôs as easy as pie, if pie were made of code. (lol)

### File Menu üëá

#### ~ The File Menu lets you create a new file, open an existing one, save the current file, or exit the application. Plus, new keybindings to make life easier:
- **New Window** (Ctrl+Shift+N)
- **Save As** (Ctrl+Shift+S)
- **Select All** (Ctrl+A)

&nbsp;

### Edit Menu üëá

<br>
<img src="https://github.com/driveloader/NotePy/blob/master/Extra/image3.png" alt="Edit Menu">

#### ~ The Edit Menu originally provided 'Cut,' 'Copy,' and 'Paste.' NotePy has added 'Undo,' 'Redo,' 'Find,' and 'Replace,' along with handy keybindings.

&nbsp;

### Format Menu üëá

#### ~ The Format Menu allows you to adjust the 'Font Size' and 'Font Style' of your text. Make your text look just the way you want it‚Äîbecause even text needs a makeover now and then.

&nbsp;

### Help Menu üëá

#### ~ The Help Menu provides an 'About NotePy' option for more information about the application and its creator.
