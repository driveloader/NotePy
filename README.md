<h1 align="center">NotePy 📓</h1>

<h3 align="center">— An Enhanced Version of Notepad (originally by pratyushjain122) Built with Python & Tkinter —</h3>

### 🔥 NotePy transforms the original notepad-python project by pratyushjain122 into a not-so-modern (but still nostalgic) yet fully-featured text editor designed for everyday use. It's a more efficient replacement for Notepad, but with a modern twist. Because why settle for ordinary when you can have extraordinary?

&nbsp;

## What is Tkinter?

#### 👉 Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit.
#### 👉 While there are other GUI toolkits for Python, Tkinter is the go-to choice due to its simplicity and seamless integration with Python.

&nbsp;

## What is NotePy?
NotePy is an upgraded text editor based on the original notepad-python project. It has a sleek user interface and enhanced features, all built using Python and Tkinter. It’s like Notepad, but without being created by a company that charges you for an operating system 💀. (You probably know what it is, MichealSoft)

&nbsp;

## Features

### Original Features (from [pratyushjain122's notepad-python project](https://github.com/pratyushjain122/notepad-python)):

1. **New File**: Create a new, blank document. Self-Explainatory
2. **Open File**: Open and load an existing file. Self-Explainatory
3. **Save File**: Save your document. Imagine losing your 2000 lines of code just because of a cat stepping on your power button. (My cat btw)
4. **Cut**: Cut selected text. Self-Explainatory (Haven't came up with a new joke **yet**)
5. **Copy**: Copy selected text. Because good ideas deserve to be duplicated, like that one meme you keep sending to everyone.
6. **Paste**: Paste text from the clipboard. Reuse like a pro—just don’t overdo it like that one guy at the buffet. (That one guy at my nearby buffet restaurant)
7. **View Help**: Access help information for the application. 

### New Features in NotePy:

1. **Enhanced Edit Menu**: Now includes "Undo," "Redo," "Find," and "Replace" features. It’s like having an editor’s undo button for life. Just don’t try to use it on your last relationship. (lol)
2. **Convenient Hotkeys**: Adds various hotkeys to streamline your workflow. 
3. **Status Bar**: Displays real-time document information, including:
   - Cursor position (line and column number). Never lose your place again—unless you accidentally move your cursor to another galaxy. 🖱️
   - Word count. Because sometimes you just need to know how many words you’ve written—and how many you still owe your novel. 💀
   - Line endings (e.g., CRLF). For the technical wizards out there. It’s like knowing whether to use a fork or a spoon.
   - File encoding (e.g., UTF-8). 
4. **Format Menu**: Adjust the global font style and size.

## What's Included in This Project 👜

### Portable Version 

- **Description**: A download-and-play version pre-compiled into an executable (.exe) that runs on any Windows machine without installation. It’s the software equivalent of a Swiss Army knife—versatile and always ready. Perfect for when you need a quick fix without the fuss!
- **Use Case**: Ideal for those who prefer a plug-and-play application or want to keep it on a USB drive. No installation required—just run and go! Like a fast-**text** drive-thru. (Get it? Fast-Food drive thru for text editing)

### Install Version 

- **Description**: Install NotePy on your machine for a smoother workflow. One-click, and it’s on your device—no more searching for the portable file. Installation makes it as easy as pie. Just don’t ask us to bake the pie!
- **Use Case**: Ideal for those who want NotePy integrated into their system for everyday use. Installation makes it easy to access NotePy without the hassle of finding and running the portable version.

### Source Code

- **Description**: The complete source code for NotePy, available for download and compilation. Obviously, what would you expect more from an open source project? (lol) It’s like a DIY kit for tech enthusiasts!
- **Use Case**: Perfect for those who prefer to compile the software themselves, have trust issues with those .exes, or need to run it on different operating systems. Great for the tryhards who compile Gentoo 10 times a day. (They exist, and they’re awesome!)

## GUI Overview 🧩

A GUI (Graphical User Interface) allows users to interact with software through visual elements like buttons, text fields, and menus. 
## We tried our best to replica to classic Notepad GUI, but remember, it's not an 100% accurate replica cuz God knows the Notepad source code. It's created by a company that creates proprietary softwares anyway. 💀

&nbsp;

## How It Works 👷‍♂️

#### ~ When you launch NotePy, a user-friendly GUI window will open, and you’ll be ready to write and edit text just like in any standard notepad application. It’s as easy as pie, if pie were made of code.💀

&nbsp;

### Format Menu 👇

#### ~ The Format Menu allows you to adjust the 'Font Size' and 'Font Style' of your text. Make your text look just the way you want it—because even text needs a makeover now and then.
